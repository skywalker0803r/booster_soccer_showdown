🔍  Analysis of Original Training Data
============================================================
📊  Original Training Analysis:
------------------------------
episode_783:
  Total reward:  -26.987
  Steps: 154
  Reward/step: -0.17524
  🤔  Mixed penalties (step + other)

episode_784:
  Total reward:  -50.692
  Steps: 239
  Reward/step: -0.21210
  ✅  Looks like pure -0.3 step penalty (Task 3)

episode_785:
  Total reward:  -16.439
  Steps: 182
  Reward/step: -0.09032
  ⚠️ Unexpected pattern

episode_786:
  Total reward:  -19.950
  Steps: 191
  Reward/step: -0.10445
  🤔  Mixed penalties (step + other)

📈  Key Insights:
  Best episode reward: +25.418 (POSITIVE!)
  Worst episode reward: -123.774
  Final average: -30.828

🔧  Step Penalty Reduction Impact:
----------------------------------------
Current (mixed)     :  -30.828 (Actual training result)
Pure -1.0 step      : -190.000 (If pure step penalty)
Pure -0.3 step      :  -57.000 (If Task 3 step penalty)
Reduced -0.01 step  :    3.100 (Our fix + some positive)

💡  Real Problem Analysis:
1. ✅  Agent IS learning (max reward +25.418!)
2. ✅  Some episodes are successful
3. ❌  Too many failed episodes bringing average down
4. ❌  Need to improve success rate, not just reduce penalties

🎯  New Strategy:
Instead of fixing step penalty, we should:
1. 🎯  Improve action quality to avoid failures
2. 📈  Add dense rewards to guide learning
3. 🚀  Focus on increasing success rate
4. ⚖️ Balance exploration vs exploitation

============================================================
🚀  RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
============================================================
1. 📊  Your agent IS learning (max +25.418 proves it works!)
2. 🎯  Focus on improving success rate
3. 📈  Use dense rewards to guide learning
4. ⚖️ Reduce action noise/improve stability
5. 🚀  Train longer with better guidance

The step penalty is NOT the main problem!
The real issue is inconsistent performance.
